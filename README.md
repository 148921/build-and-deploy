# Build and Deploy

This exercise is a JavaScript application which is only partly implemented.
Using continuous integration and continuous deployment, we will utilize some cloud tools to provide the deployment pipeline.
We will also use several tools which helps with development of JavaScript applications like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [bower](https://bower.io/) and [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/).

## What you need
* Make sure Git is installed and available on command line (`git --version` in a terminal should not produce an error). [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it.
* NodeJS with npm must be installed and available on command line (`node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal should not produce an error. You should have a NodeJS version greater than 8 and npm version greater than 5). Install from: https://nodejs.org/
* A good text editor of your choice, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/). If you don't have a favorite already, we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* If you are completely new to JavaScript, it is recommended to explore and test the language beforehand
* We will not go into the details about npm, bower and grunt. If you want to learn more about them, please see our [JavaScript Infrastructure workshop](https://github.com/nerdschoolbergen/js-infrastructure).

## How to get started

* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer, it's easier to read it on GitHub with formatting. We therefore recommend you keep a web browser tab open with the exercise tasks.
* Start by opening [exercise 1](./exercises/exercise-1.md/).
* Remember to ask an instructor if you're stuck.
